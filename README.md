# mouse2joystick_citra

This AutoHotkey script captures mouse motion and keyboard input for the use of the Virtual Controller provided by vJoy in order for it to be used as a controller for the Citra 3DS emulator. Common usage is to control a camera view with mouse motion or to use the main mouse buttons for regular gaming input. Start/stop mouse capturing with the assigned shortcut (default is "F1").

mouse2joystick_citra is based on mouse2joystick_custom_CEMU by CemuUser8 which was in turn based on the original mouse2joystick script by Helgef. Further details are in the .ahk file.
